    "In recent years quantum computing has become a buzzword and the idea of a fully working quantum computer is very exciting.  Quantum knowledge and technology has grown exponentially fast but still\n",
    "developing a non-trivial size quantum computer is not straight forward. We will probably have to wait some more years to witness their power and applicability. \n",
    "\n",
    "The quantum computers available nowadays (eg. IBM, Google, QuTech, etc) are what we call Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. They are quantum computers capable of executing quantum algorithms and calculations but where the sources of errors (eg. due to gates noise, coherence, calibration errors, etc.) limit how reliable they are. NISQ devices can be benchmarked for example using the \"quantum volume\". The quantum volume takes into account not only the number of qubits (width of a circuit) but also the number of operations (depth of a circuit) a quantum computer can handle. The depth of a circuit, is influenced by things such as the number of qubits, how qubits are interconnected, gate and measurement errors, device cross talk, circuit compiler efficiency, and more.\n",
    "Therefore, the quantum volume indicates the relative complexity of problems that can be solved by the quantum computer. The larger the number, the more powerful the quantum computer is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information in a quantum computer is stored in qubits.\n",
    "A qubit is a two state system with quantum properties. As opposed to a bit that can only be in state 0 or 1 (on or off), a state of a qubit (denoted $|\\psi>$) can be in a combination (superposition) of the two states (called basis states),\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\psi> = \\alpha|0> + \\beta|1>$\n",
    "\n",
    "The qubit is therefore not 0 or 1 (on or off), but a little bit of both (like a dimmy light). How on or how off it is depends on the coefficients $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a qubit is measured we \"force\" it to become (collpase it to) one of the basis states of the measurment. \n",
    "The probability of us measuring one state or the other (|0> or |1>) depends on how they contribute to the total state in the first place: depends on the values of $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$. The higher the value the more likely it is we measure the associated state. These numbers are known as probability amplitudes and the probability of measuring a given state is given by $\\alpha^2$ and $\\beta^2$. Since the total probability of measuring one state is 1.0, $\\alpha^2 +\\beta^2 = 1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to a classical bit, whcih can be described by only one number: 0 or 1, a qubit needs two numbers to be fully described: the probability amplitudes. Therefore, a qubit can be represented as a vector with two entries:\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\psi> = [\\alpha, \\beta]^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general however, a quantum computer does not consist of one qubit but many qubits that interact with each other. The state of the quantum computer ($|\\psi>$) is a combination of tese qubit states and hence a combination of the basis states of the n-qubit system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of basis states of a system increases with the number of qubits as $2^n$ (n=number qubits) and hence the state of the quantum computer with n-qubits is fully described by a vector with $2^n$ entries (the probability amplitudes of the basis states).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example for a system of 2-qubits each qubit can be in state |0> or |1>, this means that a 2-qubits system can  be measured in states |00>, |01>, |10> or |11> (so all possible permutations). These are the basis states. Before measuring, the 2-qubit system can be any combination of this basis states:\n",
    "\n",
    "$|\\psi> = \\alpha|00> + \\beta|01> +\\gamma|10> +\\delta|11>$ \n",
    "\n",
    "and can be fully represented by the vector $[\\alpha, \\beta,\\gamma, \\delta]^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "Modifying a quanutm state means modifiying the probability amplitudes that describe it (the entries in the above vector). Measurments are a type of operations that do this. They \"turn\" all probability amplitudes to zero, except for one, which will have a value of 1.0 (basically they project the quantum state into one of the basis states). \n",
    "There are however many other operations that can modify the entries of quantum state vector and hence the quantum state of an n-qubit system. \n",
    "These operations (called quantum gates) can be used to manipulate the quantum state into a given outcome, hence we can use them to create algorithms. A quantum gate can be represented as $2^n$x$2^n$ unitary matrices (n the number of qubits in the system). The application of quantum gates to qubits corresponds to the multiplication of the n-qubit state with the quantum gate matrix and results in a modification of the $2^n$ entries of the quantum state vector. Some gates are comparable to classical gates. For example the classical NOT gate can be compared to the quantum X gate. In classical computing the NOT-gate converts a 0 into a 1 and a 1 into a 0. The quantum X-gate swaps the probability amplitudes of both states and converts $\\alpha |0> + \\beta|1>$ into $\\beta|0> + \\alpha|0>$, which basically means the probability of measureing 0 or 1 is swap.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more examples of quantum gates we refer the reader to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate. For a more indepth knowledge of quantum gates: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.2998.pdf. How these gates are physically implemented depends on the type of qubits: trapped ions, NV centers, photons, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most quantum gates act only in a small number of qubits (mostly due to experimental limitations). This means they are sparse matrices. This is not a limitation as there exist sets of one- and two-qubit quantum gates which are universal for quantum computation: any operation possible on a quantum computer can be reduced to this set of gates.\n",

    "One classification of quantum gates is the Clifford vs non-Clifford gates(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_gates). The Clifford gates are important, because a universal gate set consists of all the Clifford gates plus one non-Clifford gate. The Clifford-gates include the Pauli-gates (I, X, Y and Z), the Hadamard gate, the S gate and the controlled-X gate. The non-Clifford gate group is an infinite group with all the other quantum gates. Clifford gates are interesting for quantum simulators because they can be simualted in polynomial time, while non-cliford gates are exponentially hard to simulate on a classical computers (Gottesman-Knill theorem). For more information about the Gottesman-Knill theorem, reading \"Improved Simulation of Stabilizer Circuits\" by Scott Aaronson and Daniel Gottesman (Aaronson and Gottesman, 2004) is recommend."

    "A quantum simulator is a program that simulates how a quantum computer works; the exact calculation of the effects of every single gate on the qubits. Quantum simulators are used to increase and facilitate the development of quantum algorithms, their testing and debugging while non-trivial size quantum computer become available. They also allow for hardware-software co-design (Haner et al. https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.06460).\n",
    "The need of quantum simulators has lead to the development of many different frameworks and libraries (for a reasonably complete list we refer the reader to https://www.quantiki.org/wiki/list-qc-simulators), so  which one should we use for a given problem? Beyond understanding the different capabilitites of the softwares it is important to understand their functionality and performance in order to chose the most appropiate one for a given application/problem.\n",

    "One of the main issues with quantum simulators is their limitations: they are normally memory bound and network bandwith limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before, the size of the quantum states and quantum gates scales exponentially with the number of qubits. This also implies that the time and memory it takes to create them and operate with them in a classical computer in general scales exponentially, whcih limits the amount of qubits we can currently simulate in a computer. With this in mind, it is interesting to compare how the execution time and memory requirements scale with the number of qubits and depth of the circuit for the different quantum simulators, so basically how complex can the algorithms we want to simulate be. In previous papers (Jones et al., 2018) random circuits have been used to benchmark the performance of quantum simulators. Here, we will follow the same approach. \n",

    "As mentioned before, given a quantum system of n-qubits, there is a continuous set of possible states: all of the different combination of the $2n$ basis states (different values of the probability amplitudes). \n",
    "The capacity of exploring all states is (in part) where the quantum computer powers shine. Classically this could take many many computational hours, months, even years, but using the quantum properties fo the system this can be doen in principle relatively fast. An important question however is: how can we check we are exploring all sattes? One way of assesing this is by randomly producing n-qubit states and verifying that they are picked uniformly. \n",
    "This task although possible is also not straight forward for a quantum computer.\n",
    "The reason behind this is that most of the states are what we call \"entangled states\", and entangled states are not only difficult to create but also highly unstable: they tend to decohere quickly due to interactions with an outside environment, which essentially drives the qubits to an unentangled state (like all qubits |0>) due to relaxation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Random quantum circuits are circuits that can generate quantum random states: when fed a constant input, they produce a random quantum state in each execution. Executing it many times yields a sample of quantum states that contains fresh randomness inherent to the quantum evaluation. Sampling the output distribution of a random  quantum circuit is a hard computational task and hence not possible with a classical computer. For the curious, this is basically what Google proved in their 2019 experiment of quantum supremacy.\n",

The X gate rotates it 180 degrees. The T and Y- gates also rotate the vector but in different ways.\n",

It can also be described as a conditional operation that performs a sign shift only when the two qubit state is |11>.\n",

    "To further develop quantum algorithms it is necessary to have quantum software. Already there are a lot of different quantum software and libraries, therefore it would be great to look at the performances of some libraries. In this notebook we saw that a lot of research papers use random circuits to benchmark quantum and with quantum software and libraries most compare the time and memory it takes to execute a circuit. The problem with quantum simulators is that there are a lot and they are all different, this means it is difficult to compare these software and libraries with each other in a benchmark. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we have looked at the two python libraries Qiskit and Qulacs. These libraries have been chosen, because they are different from each other and interesting for researchers. Qiskit is a full-stack library with a lot of documentation and beginners guides, Qulacs is said to run fast and can run on a GPU. \n",
    "\n",
    "From the benchmarks in this notebook the conclusion is that Qulacs for circuits with 20 or less qubits the fastest is, because it compresses circuits to simulate them faster. But Qiskit is best for using Clifford gates on more then 20 qubits. Qulacs uses more maximum resident set size then Qiskit. "
